# Inventory Management Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The issue was in the job card update functionality where parts inventory was not being properly reduced when job cards were updated. The problem occurred in the `updateJobCard` function in the job card controller.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Duplicate Part Handling**: When the same part appeared multiple times in the `parts_used` array, the inventory calculation logic was not properly accumulating quantities.
2. **Insufficient Logging**: There was no debugging information to track inventory changes, making it difficult to identify issues.
3. **Missing Validation**: Some edge cases in inventory management were not properly handled.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Inventory Calculation Logic
**File**: `GM/server/controller/jobcardcontroller.js`

**Problem**: In the `updateJobCard` function, the code was not properly handling cases where the same part appears multiple times in the update.

**Fix**: 
```javascript
// Before (line 230-231):
const key = partItem.part_id.toString();
newPartsMap.set(key, partItem.quantity);

// After:
const key = partItem.part_id.toString();
const currentQty = newPartsMap.get(key) || 0;
newPartsMap.set(key, currentQty + partItem.quantity);
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging
Added detailed console logging throughout the inventory management process to track:
- Existing parts mapping
- New parts processing
- Inventory change calculations
- Stock validation
- Actual inventory updates

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better error messages for insufficient stock
- Improved validation for part existence
- Added logging for successful operations

### 4. Improved Stock Tracking
- Added logging to job card creation
- Added logging to job card deletion
- Enhanced feedback for all inventory operations

## Testing

### 1. Logic Tests
**File**: `GM/test_inventory_logic.js`
- Tests the core inventory calculation logic without requiring database
- Validates handling of quantity changes, part additions, and removals
- Tests duplicate part handling

**Run**: `node test_inventory_logic.js`

### 2. API Integration Tests
**File**: `GM/test_api_inventory.js`
- Tests the complete API flow with real database operations
- Creates test data, performs operations, and validates results
- Tests job card creation, updates, and deletion
- Automatically cleans up test data

**Run**: `node test_api_inventory.js` (requires server to be running)

### 3. Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the server: `cd GM/server && npm start`
2. Open the frontend application
3. Create a job card with some parts
4. Update the job card to change part quantities
5. Check the parts inventory to verify correct stock levels
6. Monitor server console for detailed logging

## Key Improvements

### Before Fix:
- Inventory updates were inconsistent
- No visibility into what was happening during updates
- Edge cases not properly handled
- Difficult to debug issues

### After Fix:
- ✅ Consistent inventory management
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Proper handling of duplicate parts
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Automated testing capabilities

## Verification Steps

1. **Create Job Card**: Stock should decrease by the quantity used
2. **Update Job Card (Increase Quantity)**: Stock should decrease by the additional amount
3. **Update Job Card (Decrease Quantity)**: Stock should increase by the reduced amount
4. **Update Job Card (Remove Parts)**: Stock should be restored for removed parts
5. **Update Job Card (Add New Parts)**: Stock should decrease for new parts
6. **Delete Job Card**: All stock should be restored

## Console Output Examples

When updating a job card, you'll now see detailed logs like:
```
🔄 Processing parts update for job card: 64f7b1234567890abcdef123
📦 Existing parts map: [['64f7b1234567890abcdef456', 2]]
📝 Processing new parts: 1 items
📊 Part 64f7b1234567890abcdef456: adding 3, total now: 3
📦 New parts map: [['64f7b1234567890abcdef456', 3]]
📈 Part 64f7b1234567890abcdef456: 2 → 3 (change: 1)
🔄 Inventory changes to apply: [['64f7b1234567890abcdef456', 1]]
✅ Stock check for Test Brake Pad: available 8, need 1
📦 Applied inventory change for part 64f7b1234567890abcdef456: -1, new stock: 7
```
