The welcome email will be automatically sent to `john.doe@example.com`.

### Manual Testing
Run the test files to verify functionality:
```bash
# Test with actual email sending (requires SMTP configuration)
node server/test_employee_welcome_email.js

# Test functionality without sending emails
node server/test_employee_welcome_functionality.js
```
